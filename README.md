# MC Whack-a-stack (mcwas)

## Description
Stacks of entities have the same knockback as individual ones, regardless of who in the stack is whacked. This accounts for entity damage inflicted by `knockback` or `punch` enchantments and respects the `knockback_resistance` attribute. 

## Usage
Whack a stack of entities and watch them fly. Entity types can be excluded from this behavior by removing them from the `whack_a_stackable.json` entity type file.
